# RL in robotics
Multi-rotor drones and multi-drone systems are increasingly garnering attention due to their remarkable agility and versatility. However, many current drone simulators face challenges, including low sampling efficiency and difficulties in customization. The NICS-EFC group at Tsinghua University developed an efficitnet and flexible simulation platform, OmniDrones for testing and depolying reinforcement learning in drone control, which stands out for several reasons:  
Firsty, leveraging Nvidia's Isaac Sim, OmniDrones impressively achieves over $10^5$ steps per second in data collection. This efficiency is pivotal for the successful application of large-scale RL-based methods.  
Secondly, OmniDrones offers four default drone models that are commonly referenced in research and it provides four control modes and five sensor modalities, all of which are designed for easy modification and extension. The platform is also accept xacro files to make it easier for researchers to introduce customized dynamics and to transfer their work into ROS operating system.  
Thirdly, OmniDrones boasts a comprehensive suite of more than 10 tasks for both single and multi-agent scenarios. These tasks, which span a range of challenges and difficulty levels, can be effortlessly expanded and are compatible with contemporary RL libraries.

Problems in existing drone simulators
* Low sampling efficiency.
* Difficulties in customization. 

Highlights of our **Omnidrones**
* Efficiency: over $10^5$ steps per second in data collection
* Flexibility: easy for users to import models and add customized dynamics 
* RL-Support: design tasks of varying challenges and difficulty levels for RL

## Track for inverted pendulum system
The following is a track task designed for a drone-based inverted pendulum system. The goal is to track a reference lemniscate trajectory in the 3D space for the payload.

## Pong game
The idea of this task is from the Atari's video game Pong. The goal is to bounce the ball and keep it off the ground.
