I am currently a research engineer under the supervision of Prof Yu Wang in [NICS-EFC](https://nicsefc.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/) group at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). I received an undergraduate Master of Physics at [Oxford University](https://www.ox.ac.uk/) in 2020 and a Master of Scientific Computing at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) in 2021. After graduation, I served as a quant researcher in Bohong Capital in Shanghai for one year.  
I am dedicated to uniting reinforcement learning for agile robotics control. My research interest is to enhance robots' capabilities to plan and act for cooperation tasks with both reliability and adaptability. In addition, I am also enthusiastic about the optimization of energy and resource allocation in robotics systems by leveraging innovative data-driven methods.
