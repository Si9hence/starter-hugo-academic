I am currently an internship engineering under the supervision of Prof Yu Wang in [NICS-EFC](https://nicsefc.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/) group at Tsinghua University. I am dedicated to uniting reinforcement learning and control for agile robotics.  
I received a 4-year Mphys in Physics degree at the University of Oxford at 2020. I then completed another master's degree in Scientific and Data Intensive Computing at the University College London at 2021.  
My research interest is to empower robots in navigating **unstructured environments** with both **reliability and adaptability**. By leveraging innovative data-driven methods, I aim to enhance robots' understanding of the physical world through interactive exploration.
