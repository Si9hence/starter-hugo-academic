I am currently a PhD candidate under the supervision of Prof AJITHA RAJAN [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). I'm working on enforcing safety in AI, working closely with [Codeplay Software](https://codeplay.com/) and [The data lab](https://thedatalab.com/).

I received an undergraduate Master of Physics at [Oxford University](https://www.ox.ac.uk/) in 2020 and a Master of Scientific Computing at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) in 2021. After graduation, I served as a quant researcher in Bohong Capital in Shanghai for one year and a research assistant at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) under the supervision of Prof Yu Wang in [NICS-EFC](https://nicsefc.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/) group.

My research interests concern the verification of learned models and safety enforcement for the contral system of the interaction among cyber physical systems.
