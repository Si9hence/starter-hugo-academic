I am currently an internship engineer under the supervision of Prof Yu Wang in [NICS-EFC](https://nicsefc.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/) group at Tsinghua University.  I received a 4-year Mphys in Physics at the University of Oxford at 2020 and a second Master's degree in scientific computing at the University College London at 2021. After graduation, I servered as a quant researcher in Bohong Capital in Shanghai for one year.  
I am dedicated to uniting reinforcement learning for agile robotics control. My research interest is to enhance robots' capabilities to plan and act for cooperation tasks with both **reliability and adaptability**. In addition, I am also enthusiastic about the optimization of energy and resource allocation in robotics systems by leveraging innovative data-driven methods.
