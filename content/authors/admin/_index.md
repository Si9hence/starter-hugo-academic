I am an internship engineering in https://nicsefc.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/ affiliated with Department of Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua University. I am dedicated to uniting reinforcement learning and control for agile robotics.
My ultimate goal is to empower robots to navigate **unstructured environments** with both **reliability and adaptability**. By leveraging innovative data-driven methods, I aim to enhance robots' understanding of the physical world through interactive exploration.
